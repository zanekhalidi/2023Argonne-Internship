Introduction

Here at Argonne, we collect x-rays generated by a synchrotron ring using area detectors for various research purposes. However, some high-energy particles from the universe (known as cosmic rays) can penetrate the atmosphere, and even penetrate our lead walls which are used for keeping outside sources from getting in and scrambling up our x-ray data. They usually leave bright tails on the detector which ruins our data. We want to develop software/algorithms to eliminate the signals of cosmic rays. 








Background on cosmic rays:


Cosmic rays are high energy particles that originate from the sun, from outside the solar system in our own galaxy and from distant galaxies. Upon reaching earths atmosphere most rays produce second particles and the bulk dont enter the surface. A significant amount of cosmic rays originate from supernova explosions of stars. During the years from 1930 to 1945, a wide variety of investigations confirmed that the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons, and the secondary radiation produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons, photons and muons. In 1948, observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to near the top of the atmosphere showed that approximately 10% of the primaries are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and 1% are nuclei of heavier elements such as carbon, iron, and lead.[37][38]  There are 3 types of cosmic rays Primary cosmic rays, secondary cosmic rays and cosmic-ray flux. Primary cosmic rays mostly originate from outside the Solar System and sometimes even outside the Milky Way. Primary cosmic rays are composed mainly of protons and alpha particles (99%), with a small amount of heavier nuclei (â‰ˆ1%) and an extremely minute proportion of positrons and antiprotons.

Secondary rays. When cosmic rays enter the Earth's atmosphere, they collide with atoms and molecules, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. The interaction produces a cascade of lighter particles, a so-called air shower secondary radiation that rains down, including x-rays, protons, alpha particles, pions, muons, electrons, neutrinos, and neutrons.[67] All of the secondary particles produced by the collision continue onward on paths within about one degree of the primary particle's original path.
